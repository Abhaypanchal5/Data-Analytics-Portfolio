# 📊 Sales Data Analysis Using SQL

## Project Summary

This project analyzes a retail sales database using SQL to answer key
business questions related to revenue performance, customer behavior,
and growth trends.

The objective was to simulate real-world analytical reporting scenarios
using structured relational data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Database Structure

The analysis is based on four related tables:

-   Customers\
-   Orders\
-   Order Items\
-   Products

Foreign keys were implemented to maintain referential integrity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Business Analysis Performed

-   Calculated total company revenue\
-   Generated revenue per order\
-   Identified top customers by lifetime value\
-   Determined top 2 customers per city using partitioned ranking\
-   Computed monthly revenue per customer\
-   Performed month-over-month revenue comparison using LAG()\
-   Detected customers with consecutive monthly revenue growth

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## SQL Concepts Demonstrated

-   Multi-table JOINs\
-   Aggregation (SUM, GROUP BY)\
-   Subqueries\
-   Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, DENSE_RANK, LAG)\
-   Time-series analysis\
-   Partitioned ranking\
-   Growth trend detection

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Business Insights

-   Revenue is concentrated among top customers.\
-   Spending behavior varies by city.\
-   Time-series analysis identifies growth and decline patterns.\
-   A subset of customers demonstrates sustained revenue growth.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the ability to translate business problems
into SQL queries, perform structured data analysis, and generate
actionable insights --- reflecting practical, job-ready Data Analyst
skills.
