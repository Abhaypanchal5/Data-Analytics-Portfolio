📊 Academic Performance Analysis System
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes student academic performance using Python and pandas.
The goal is to extract meaningful insights from raw student marks data and generate performance reports.

This simulates how a Data Analyst would analyze academic results for a school or institution.

🎯 Problem Statement

Calculate total and average marks of students

Identify toppers

Detect failed students

Analyze subject-wise performance

Generate structured result reports

The administration wants data-driven insights to improve academic performance.

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

CSV file handling

Jupyter Notebook

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains:

Student Name

Marks in Math

Marks in Science

Marks in English

🔍 Key Analysis Performed
✅ 1. Total & Average Calculation

Computed total marks for each student

Calculated average score

✅ 2. Topper Identification

Identified highest scoring student

✅ 3. Fail Detection Logic

Students scoring below 50 in any subject marked as “Fail”

✅ 4. Subject-wise Analysis
